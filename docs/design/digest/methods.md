# Software design methods

The purpose of a design method is to provide the framework that enables the designer to develop the design
in a systematic manner @@Budgen2003.
Design methods consist of

1. A representation part that provides descriptive forms of models of the problem and its solutions.
2. A process part that describes how to transform the models.
    Each transformation takes a model as input and outputs another model, with the designer adding information.
    A transformation may keep the descriptive form of the model the same (elaboration) or change or reinterpret it
    (transformation of viewpoint).
    Each transformation is a design decision that the designer should record.
3. Heuristics that provide guidance on how to execute the process part for specific classes of problems.

Most design methods lack a strong theoretical underpinning and are empirical in nature.
They usually provide strategic guidance, rather than detailed instructions.
