# Introduction

This part of the book builds the foundations for the rest of the book.
We start by introducing the fundamentals of [engineering](engineering.md) and [software](software.md).
We then put them together to get a sense of what [software engineering](software-engineering.md) should look like.
We conclude with a word on the organization of the book and the origin of its title.
