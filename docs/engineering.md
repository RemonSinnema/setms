# Engineering

If the goal is for software development to be an engineering discipline, then we should understand what
engineering means.

```admonish tldr title="Definition"
**Engineering** is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process to solve
technical problems, increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems.

--- @@Brockman2009
```

The two fundamental aspects here are applying science and following a defined process.
Let's look at those in a bit more detail.


## Applied science

```admonish tldr title="Definition"
**Science** is a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as
obtained and tested through the scientific method.

```

```admonish tldr title="Definition"
The **scientific method** are principles and procedures for the systematic pursuit of knowledge involving the
recognition and formulation of a problem, the collection of data through observation and experiment, and the
formulation and testing of hypotheses.

--- @@MerriamWebsterScientificMethod
```

The _scientific method_ involves making observations, formulating hypotheses based on those observations,
running experiments to falsify the hypotheses, and generalizing hypotheses into a theory.
These activities form a loop:

Scientific knowledge grows over time.
Little discoveries here and there build on each other to reach truly impressive gains in understanding.

Application of the scientific method leads to scientific theories that engineering then applies to solve practical
problems.
For instance, electrical engineering applies the theory of electromagnetism @@Jackson1999.


## Design process

Engineering follows a well-defined process to solving problems:

Note that this process shares similarities with the scientific method.
The major difference is that engineering is about _making_ something.


## Evolution of an engineering discipline

Engineering applies science and uses a design process.
Both of these take time to develop, so a new field of engineering necessarily grows from humble beginnings.
@@Shaw1990 provides the following model of such evolution:

Before we judge where software development falls in this model, let's look at software in more detail.
