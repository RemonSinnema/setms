# Engineering process

[Redundancy and diversity](../../design/digest.md) are techniques for developing
[dependable](../../requirements/digest/elicitation.md#non-functional-requirements) systems.
We can also use them to develop dependable processes.
In a **dependable process**, activities use redundant and diverse techniques.
For instance, verification & validation may use code reviews, static code analysis, automated tests and manual tests.

Evidence that the team followed a dependable process is often important in convincing regulators that the organization
complies with laws and regulations.
To be convincing, the process must be explicitly defined and repeatable.
An **explicitly defined process** has a process model that drives software development.
The organization must collect data to prove the team followed the process as defined in this process model.
A **repeatable process** is one that doesn't rely on individual interpretation and judgement.

Dependable process are auditable, diverse, documentable, robust, and standardized.
A dependable software development process contains [quality management](../../quality.md) and
[change management](../../configuration-management.md) processes.
