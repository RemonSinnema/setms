# Validation

**Validation** confirms that you have the correct set of requirements to enable developers to build
a solution that satisfies the business objectives.

Various studies suggest that errors introduced during requirements activities account for 40-50% of all defects found
in a software product.
The major consequence of requirements problems is rework.
Rework often consumes 30-50% of total development cost, and requirements errors make up 70-85% of that.

A major source of requirements issues is ambiguity, which leads to different expectations on the part of various
stakeholders.
To combat this:

- Have people who represent different perspectives inspect the requirements in a workshop.
- Write tests against the requirements.
- Build prototypes.

Reject requirements that don't contribute to the stated business objectives.
Likewise, exclude business rules that don't need implementing in software.

Ensure that requirements have acceptance criteria and, if possible, acceptance tests.
Examples of acceptance criteria that unsuitable for capturing in acceptance tests:

- The number of open issues is under some maximum.
- Documentation is available.
- Users received training.

For stakeholders to validate requirements, they must understand them.
Formal methods and certain diagram styles are foreign to most users, so the best way to specify requirements is still
in text form.
Structured natural language is often better than free-form text.
