# Requirements management

Everyone must agree on the requirements:

- The sponsor agrees that the requirements achieve the business objectives.
- Customers agree that the requirements address their needs.
- Developers agree that the requirements are possible and verifiable.

A **requirements baseline** is a set of reviewed and agreed upon requirements that serves as the basis for development.
The analyst should place the baseline under change and version control.
For effective change control, there needs to be a process for proposing, evaluating, and deciding on requirement changes.
Impact analysis helps to assess the cost of proposed changes, as does having a traceability matrix.

A **requirements traceability matrix** is a set of links between requirements and other artifacts, such as design and
code elements.
It also links functional requirements to higher-level user requirements, business requirements, business rules, and
system requirements.
Each requirement is one record in a Requirements Management (RM) system.
Requirements have attributes, like origin, priority, and status.

When possible, organize requirements into related sets and deliver those sets incrementally.
Breaking delivery down like this helps in dealing with changes.

Changes in requirements are inevitable:

- Stakeholders don't know precisely what they want at te beginning of the project.
- Stakeholders can sometimes articulate what they want only after seeing something that doesn't quite match their vision.
- Business needs may change during the course of the project.
