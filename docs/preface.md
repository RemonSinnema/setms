In 1989, I went to college to study business informatics.
One of the classes I took was  _Software Engineering_.
It taught us the process of how to develop software.

In my first job out of college, I ran into problems applying this process.
Subject-matter experts didn't agree on the requirements.
And when they did agree, they changed their minds, even after implementation was complete.
During implementation, we'd find issues with the design.
Budget and schedule overruns of 200% were common.

In my youthful ignorance, I blamed fickle customers.
My second job was working for a product company, where I didn't interact directly with customers anymore.
That didn't solve my problems.
We had fixed scope and deadlines, resulting in poor quality and lots of bug fixing.

In my third job I read @@beck2000 and started to see a way out of the misery.
I introduced eXtreme Programming into the organization and achieved some initial successes.
At the first bump in the road, however, the CEO forbid us to do any more pair programming.

And so it continued with every job I had after that.
I've never had the feeling that we as an industry have figured out how to do software development _well_.
It has never felt like _engineering_ to me.

This book is my attempt to survey the field and see how far away that ideal is.
