# Preface

<!-- vale Google.FirstPerson = NO -->

In 1989, I went to college to study business informatics, or applied computer science.
One of the classes I took was  _Software Engineering_.
It taught us the process of how to develop software.

In my first job out of college, I ran into problems applying this process.
Subject-matter experts didn't agree on the requirements.
And when they did agree, they changed their minds, even after implementation was complete.
During implementation, we'd find issues with the design.
Budget and schedule overruns of 200% were common.

In my youthful ignorance, I blamed fickle customers.
My second job was working for a product company, where I didn't interact directly with customers anymore.
That didn't solve my problems, though.
We had fixed scope and deadlines, resulting in poor quality and lots of time spent fixing bugs.

In my third job I read @@Beck2000 and started to see a way out of the misery.
I introduced eXtreme Programming into the organization and achieved some initial successes.
At the first bump in the road, however, the CEO forbid us to do any more pair programming.

And so it continued with every job I had after that.
I've never had the feeling that we as an industry have figured out how to do software development _well_.
It has never felt like _engineering_ to me.

This book is my attempt to survey the field and see how far away that ideal is.

The material that follows is in written form, because I firmly believe that writing is thinking.
It's a book rather than a blog post or series of posts because there is a lot of ground to cover.
Writing this book is the most ambitious thing I've ever done.
I may not even finish it, but I'm sure I'll learn a lot on the way.
And maybe it'll help you too.
