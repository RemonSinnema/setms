# Software engineering

```admonish tldr title="Definition"
**Software Engineering** is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development,
operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

--- @@ISO/IEC_2382:2015

The term _software engineering_ was first used in the title of a NATO conference in 1968 @@Naur1969 :
<!-- vale Microsoft.Adverbs = NO -->
<!-- vale write-good.Passive = NO -->

> The phrase ‘software engineering’ was deliberately chosen as being provocative, in implying the need
> for software manufacture to be based on the types of theoretical foundations and practical disciplines,
> that are traditional in the established branches of engineering.

<!-- vale write-good.Passive = YES -->
<!-- vale Microsoft.Adverbs = YES -->
Since then, people have worked towards this goal to make software development an engineering discipline.


## SWEBOK

Some of that work has taken place at the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://www.ieee.org/)
(IEEE).
This professional association for electrical engineers and related disciplines discusses different knowledge areas
in what they call societies.

The [Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/) (IEEE CS) "engages computer engineers, scientists, academia,
and industry professionals from all areas of computing."
It also "sets the standard for the education and engagement that fuels continued global technological advancement."

One of its publications is _The Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge_ (SWEBOK).
SWEBOK describes generally accepted knowledge about software engineering.
The current version is V3 @@SWEBOK2014, while V4 is under review @@SWEBOK2022.

The SWEBOK organizes material in knowledge areas (KAs):

1. Software Requirements
1. Software Design
1. Software Construction
1. Software Testing
1. Software Maintenance
1. Software Configuration Management
1. Software Engineering Management
1. Software Engineering Process
1. Software Engineering Models and Methods
1. Software Quality
1. Software Engineering Professional Practice
1. Software Engineering Economics
1. Computing Foundations
1. Mathematical Foundations
1. Engineering Foundations

Knowledge areas 13-15 provide the theoretical foundations.
KA 8 describes the engineering process, while 1-5 cover the activities in that process.
The other KAs deal with related topics.

SWEBOK V4 recognizes 18 KAs, introducing architecture, operations, and security as separate areas.

Each knowledge area breaks down into topics and subtopics, summarizing the key concepts and including a
reference list for detailed information.

IEEE CS stresses that SWEBOK is a _guide_ to the body of knowledge for software engineering.
The body of knowledge itself consists of the literature that SWEBOK references.
Appendix C contains a list of 36 books that together cover all the KAs.
